1.'1.Scrape suburbs and postcode.ipynb'\
  **Description**: This jupyternotebook scraped all the suburb's name of Voctoria\
  **Output**: 'australian_postcodes.csv' in ***data/landing*** file

2.'2.Scrape Domain.ipynb'\
  **Description**: This jupyternotebook scraped 8000+ rental properties in Victoria\
  **Output**: 'properties.csv' in ***data/landing*** file

3.'3.scrape-additional.ipynb'\
   **Description**: This jupyternotebook scraped the public services in each suburb, such as hosipital, train station, etc.\
   **Output**:'park.csv', 'stations_and_suburbs.csv', 'victoria_shopping_centres.csv', 'hospital_health_services_addresses.csv' in ***data/landing*** file

4.'4.Data Preprocessing.ipynb'\
  **Description**: This jupyternotebook details all preprocessing steps of the main dataset 'properties.csv' and other additional dataset, and then combined them into a single dataset.\
  **notice** 'Crime.csv' and 'Criminal.numbers' is downloaded from 'https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/crime-statistics/latest-victorian-crime-data/download-data', since 'Criminal.csv' is too big and unable to uploaded it onto Github, therefore we upload it in 'Criminal.numbers' format, before using it you might need to transfer it into .csv form.\
  **Output**: 'LGA With Postcodes.csv', 'cleaned_hospital_health_services_addresses.csv', 'cleaned_park.csv', 'cleaned_properties.csv', 'cleaned_stations_and_suburbs.csv', 'cleaned_victoria_shopping_centres.csv',  'clean_data.csv', 'combined_data.csv', 'full_data.csv' in ***data/raw*** file 'final_data_full.csv', 'final_data_num.csv' in ***data/curated*** file
